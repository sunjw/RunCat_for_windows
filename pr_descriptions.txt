PR 1: GPU Info Display
================================================================================

## Context of Contribution

- [ ] Bug Fix
- [ ] Refactoring
- [x] New Feature
- [ ] Others

## Summary of the Proposal

Add GPU utilization monitoring and display in the system tray tooltip and System Info menu. Uses Windows Performance Counters (GPU Engine category) for safe, driver-free GPU monitoring.

## Reason for the new feature

- Users want to see GPU usage alongside CPU/Memory/Storage/Network stats
- GPU monitoring is a commonly requested feature for system monitors
- Uses safe Windows APIs (Performance Counters) - no third-party drivers
- Graceful fallback: shows 0% if GPU counters unavailable
- Minimal maintenance: one new file (GPURepository.cs) with pattern matching existing repos

- [x] Code follows proper indentation and naming conventions.

PR 2: Speed Source Selection
================================================================================

## Context of Contribution

- [ ] Bug Fix
- [ ] Refactoring
- [x] New Feature
- [ ] Others

## Summary of the Proposal

Add user setting to choose what metric (CPU, GPU, or Memory) determines the cat's running speed. Adds a "Speed based on" submenu in Settings with radio-style selection. GPU option is hidden if GPU monitoring is unavailable.

## Reason for the new feature

- Requested by maintainer: allow users to configure which metric affects speed
- Some users prefer GPU load to drive animation (gamers, GPU-intensive work)
- Some users prefer Memory usage (developers with many apps open)
- Default remains CPU for backward compatibility
- GPU option automatically hidden if Performance Counters unavailable
- Minimal UI: simple radio submenu in existing Settings menu
